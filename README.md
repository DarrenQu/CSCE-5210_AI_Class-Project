## Introduction

The images are format into a .csv file with 2 columns. The first column is consented of the labels and it has the different 'emotions' (0) angry, (1) disgusted, (2) fearful, (3) happy, (4) sad, (5) surprised, (6) neutral. The second column is the 'data' which are the different pixels in the images. The total count was 30000 images in our dataset.
